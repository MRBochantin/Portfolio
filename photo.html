                <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
                    <p>This was a photography project about capturing high-fidelity close-up images, to highlight detail and texture. The final assignment was submitted as a full print from the classrooms 36‚Äù photo printer, so this was a 3x4.5 foot print. No photoshop could be used, only camera settings, since this was a photography class not a digital editing or photography one.</p>
                <h2>Creation Process:</h2>
                    <p>Since I was already building a new computer and had the parts laying around, I laid out the circuits and set up my tripod for a test shoot. My teacher made a comment about my lack of a lighting setup which left the florescent lighting on the left and natural lighting from outside on the right to compete and how the color variation was causing attention to be lot from the components. So, going back for my reshoot I set the camera to drop all color value and capture in black and white only.</p>

                <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
                    <p>Taking a series of images from a stationary tripod location and editing them together to create something new or impossible. The idea was to show the importance of object placement and digital manipulation to realistically blend picture together or remove unwanted elements. The example the teacher provided was 20 pictures of a busy highway shot from an overpass, edited together until the highway was completely empty.</p>
                <h2>Creation Process:</h2>
                    <p>While I never was good at creative image framing, I loved photoshop editing pictures. While I have a dozen or o other pictures from this same assignment, I included thee two as my favorites. I had my sister as the only person in each picture, and wanted to emphasize actions that could only be completed if there actually were more than one of her. The first image was of her helping herself move into a house, and the latter is of her juggling.<br>
                    The second picture actually took a lot longer to get right because in order to get the floating objects I had her hold it and then crop her out, but since shadows are a lot harder to cut cleanly, I had to create my own. Essentially, I could not cleanly crop her shadow out and leave the objects shadow, so I had to make all the object shadows by hand.</p>

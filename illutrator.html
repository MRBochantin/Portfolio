                <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create a simple infographic for a company of our choice. It had to include the logo, a call to action, and accurate information. In addition to thee requirements the image had to be rather small, intended to be shown on social media as a bite size standalone piece.</p>
                <h2>Creation Process:</h2>
                    <p>I chose Amnesty International because I was coming off the tails of a more political class and already had some knowledge on their efforts. So, pulling some information from their website on refugee hot countries and a quote from Robert Ingersoll (a human rights activist) I composed the above infographic. I tried to keep text from overlapping the map, matched color schemes with the brands own logo, and set it up to look like one of their own.</p>

                <div class="tab"><h1>Easter Clipart & The One That Got Away</h1></div>
                <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
                    <p>These two projects were created on the same week covering the same lesson, though each had separate instructions. Taking pictures of real-world objects and (without tracing them) give them purpose by deigning them in Illustrator. First repurposing objects as clip art or stickers, then repurposing them to tell a story or comic.</p>
                <h2>Creation Process:</h2>
                    <p>With a collection of various pictures (peeps marshmallows, baskets, trucks, fish, an old man in a rain jacket, and some flowers) I made an easter themed sticker set and a panel-based story called “The one that got away”. The design was fairly simplistic but due to the number of lines in the wood storyboard edges it lagged quite a lot so I had to output the later one much smaller than intended. Overall though I was able to complete both with a few re-used assets like the repeating grass from the stickers or the repeating wood borders just rotated.</p>

                <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create an instructional pamphlet for a basic skill that people may not know about. By using a limited set of color or detail, and framing it to be a regular paper size image. Something that can be included along with the item it is providing instructions for.</p>
                <h2>Creation Process:</h2>
                    <p>I vaguely remember a tent pitching hand out form back in Boy Scouts that looked something like this so I was basing it off memory. The idea was that by following steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 you could easily pitch one of these old A-frame tents, or go 4, 3, 2, 1 to take it down and put away. So, using freehand drawing I made some basic tent images, labeled important parts of each step, and used a rustic looking font to match the old tyle of tent.</p>
